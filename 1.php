                <b>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</b>
                COVID-19 is mainly transmitted when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets/aerosols and small airborne particles containing the virus. Infected people exhale those particles as they breathe, talk, cough, sneeze, or sing.Transmission is more likely the more physically close people are. However, infection can occur over longer distances, particularly indoors.Most commonly, the peak viral load in upper respiratory tract samples occurs close to the time of symptom onset and declines after the first week after symptoms begin.Current evidence suggests a duration of viral The disease often spreads in clusters, where infections can be traced back to an index case or geographical location.up to ten days following symptom onset for people with mild to moderate COVID-19, and up to 20 days for persons with severe COVID-19, including immunocompromised people.

                    <h2>Treatment</h2>
                    <p>Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include getting vaccinated, staying at home, wearing a mask in public, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others, ventilating indoor spaces, managing potential exposure durations,washing hands with soap and water often and for at least twenty seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.

                <li>
                    <h3>Vaccine</h3>
                    <p>A COVID-19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Face masks and respiratory hygiene</h3>
                    <p>The WHO and the US CDC recommend individuals wear non-medical face coverings in public settings where there is an increased risk of transmission and where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.This recommendation is meant to reduce the spread of the disease by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals and is complementary to established preventive measures such as social distancing.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Indoor ventilation and avoiding crowded indoor spaces</h3>
                    <p>The CDC recommends that crowded indoor spaces should be avoided.When indoors, increasing the rate of air change, decreasing recirculation of air and increasing the use of outdoor air can reduce transmission.The WHO recommends ventilation and air filtration in public spaces to help clear out infectious aerosols.Exhaled respiratory particles can build-up within enclosed spaces with inadequate ventilation.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Hand-washing and hygiene</h3>
                    <p>The WHO also recommends that individuals wash hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing one's nose.When soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60% alcohol.For areas where commercial hand sanitisers are not readily available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production.</p>

                    <h3>Social distancing</h3>
                    <p>Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control actions intended to slow the spread of the disease by minimising close contact between individuals. Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres. Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Surface cleaning</h3>
                    <p>After being expelled from the body, coronaviruses can survive on surfaces for hours to days. If a person touches the dirty surface, they may deposit the virus at the eyes, nose, or mouth where it can enter the body and cause infection.Evidence indicates that contact with infected surfaces is not the main driver of COVID-19,leading to recommendations for optimised disinfection procedures to avoid issues such as the increase of antimicrobial resistance through the use of inappropriate cleaning products and processes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Self-isolation</h3>
                    <p>Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they have been infected. Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation.Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations. The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high-risk groups</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>International travel-related control measures</h3>
                    <p>A 2021 Cochrane rapid review found that based upon low-certainty evidence, international travel-related control measures such as restricting cross-border travel may help to contain the spread of COVID-19. Additionally, symptom/exposure-based screening measures at borders may miss many positive cases.While test-based border screening measures may be more effective, it could also miss many positive cases if only conducted upon arrival without follow-up.</p>
