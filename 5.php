                <b>Any dysfunction of the butterfly-shaped gland at the base of the neck (thyroid).</b>
                Thyroid dysfunction is one of the most common endocrine disorders in women of childbearing age [1], second only to diabetes mellitus. Approximately 2-3% of women are diagnosed prenatally with abnormal thyroid function; however, a greater number may go undetected due to lack of consensus on testing and treatment modalities during pregnancy [2-4].The thyroid gland is a small organ that's located in the front of the neck, wrapped around the windpipe (trachea). It's shaped like a butterfly, smaller in the middle with two wide wings that extend around the side of your throat. The thyroid is a gland. You have glands throughout your body, where they create and release substances that help your body do a specific thing. Your thyroid makes hormones that help control many vital functions of your body.When your thyroid doesn't work properly, it can impact your entire body.

                        <b>Hypothyroidism: </b>Hypothyroidism is also called underactive thyroid.A condition in which the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough thyroid hormone.Hypothyroidism's deficiency of thyroid hormones can disrupt such things as heart rate, body temperature and all aspects of metabolism. Hypothyroidism is most prevalent in older women.

                    <li>
                        <b>Hyperthyroidism: </b>Hyperthyroidism also called as overactive thyroid.The overproduction of a hormone by the butterfly-shaped gland in the neck (thyroid). Hyperthyroidism is the production of too much thyroxine hormone. It can increase metabolism.

                    <h2>Treatment</h2>
                    <p>The treatment for your thyroid condition depends on the type of thyroid problem and whether your thyroid is overactive, underactive, enlarged, or is cancerous.</p>
                    <h3>Hyperthyroidism</h3>
                    <p><b>Treatments include</b> radioactive iodine, medication and sometimes surgery.</p>

                    
                     <li> <b>Anti-thyroid drugs (methimazole and propylthioracil): </b>These are medications that stop your thyroid from making hormones.</li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Radioactive iodine: </b>This treatment damages the cells of your thyroid, preventing it from making high levels of thyroid hormones.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Beta blockers: </b>These medications don't change the amount of hormones in your body, but they help manage your symptoms.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Surgery: </b>A more permanent form of treatment, your healthcare provider may surgically remove your thyroid (thyroidectomy). This will stop it from creating hormones. However, you will need to take thyroid replacement hormones for the rest of your life.
                        </li>

                    
                    <h3>Hypothyroidism</h3>
                    <p><b>Treatment</b> consists of thyroid hormone replacement.</p>
                    
                        <li>
                            <b>Thyroid replacement medication: </b>This drug is a synthetic (man-made) way to add thyroid hormones back into your body. One drug thatâ€™s commonly used is called levothyroxine. By using a medication, you can manage thyroid disease and live a normal life.
                        </li>
